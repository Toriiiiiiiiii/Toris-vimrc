# Tori's VimRC
Hii! This is my vimrc that I made because my neovim config was too bloated, and I wanted to challenge myself to improve at using vim. This is a pretty minimal config, only making use of a few plugins, and not using any fancy colorschemes and stuff.

If for some reason you wish to use this config yourself, I have provided a simple `install.sh` script that you can run to back up your existing config and start using this one.

NB: This config makes use of a custom-made plugin, [vim-com](https://github.com/Toriiiiiiiiii/vim-com.git), which adds an emacs-style compile command to vim.


Enjoy!!
